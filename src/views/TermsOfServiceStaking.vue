By accessing, connecting your wallet to, or otherwise using the Interface, or by acknowledging agreement to the Terms on the Interface, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted all of the Terms.

            <b>8. ASSUMPTION OF RISK</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as ether (ETH) and the FINSCHIA token (FNSA), and other similar kinds of digital tokens. In particular, you understand that, under normal circumstances, blockchain-based transactions are irreversible, but block reorganizations and other blockchain network irregularities have a possibility of occurring. You also understand that entities in networks such as the Ethereum blockchain, such as validators or relayers, may refuse to include transactions in blocks they produce at-will, a dynamic which we do not have explicit control over.
          </p>
          <p>
            You further represent that you understand (a) the Interface that facilitates access to features of the Finschia, the use of which has many inherent risks, and (b) that cryptographic and blockchain-based systems have inherent risks to which you are exposed when using the Interface. You further understand that the markets for blockchain-based digital assets are highly volatile due to factors that include, but are not limited to, adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with blockchain-based systems, such as Ethereum, are variable and may increase or decrease, respectively, drastically at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You hereby acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks associated with the Interface, Finschia, or FNSA and expressly agree to not hold us liable should any of the above risks occur or for any resulting losses. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Finschia.
          </p>
          <h4 class="mt-5 text-uppercase text-bold">

Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby expressly release and forever discharge us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your access to and use of the Interface. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY APPLICABLE PROVISION IN LAW OR REGULATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES IN SUBSTANCE: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
          <h4 class="mt-5 text-uppercase text-bold">
            <b>10. INDEMNITY</b>

            <b>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b>
          </h4>
          Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to any access to or use of the Interface, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access to or use of the Interface, or from any access to or use of any information obtained by any unauthorized access to or use of the Interface.

Under no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, consultants, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, or losses. This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in the Terms may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
          <h4 class="mt-5 text-uppercase text-bold">
            <b>12. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>
          </h4>
          These Terms and any dispute arising out of or in connection with the subject matter of these Terms are governed by the laws of Abu Dhabi Global Market, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Courts to determine any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or its subject matter, existence, negotiation, validity, termination or enforceability (including any non-contractual dispute or claim). You further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and that, although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

            <b>13. CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>
